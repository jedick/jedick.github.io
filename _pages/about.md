As far as I am aware, this is the first hand-crafted website titled “Learning with Machines”. My searches in November 2024 turned up other resources with similar titles:

- A Medium Blog titled “[Learning with Machines](https://medium.com/@machinelearningjourney)”. When I checked, that blog had eleven posts all made in February 2023. To me, it looks like AI-generated content, but that is just my opinion.
- A page on Mind Foundry titled “[Artificial Intelligence: Learning with Machines](https://www.mindfoundry.ai/resources/learning-with-machines)”.
- A book chapter by Jeremy Knox, “[Learning with Machines: Divisions and Transformations in the Era of Datafication](https://doi.org/10.1515/9783839471005-006)”.
- A post on the HSA Blog from Harvey Mudd College, “[Learning With Machines, by Ekaterina Babinsteva](https://www.hmc.edu/hsa/2020/10/21/learning-with-machines-by-ekaterina-babinsteva/)”.

I welcome feedback about this site, my software projects or research, or other questions. My email address is j3ffdick@gmail.com and most people call me Jeff.
