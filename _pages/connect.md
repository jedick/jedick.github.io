## <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> What Sets Me Apart

I don't just implement algorithms—I solve meaningful problems:

**Problem-first thinking:** Academic training taught me to ask the right questions before building solutions.  
**Production-ready mindset:** 15+ years maintaining production software means I build for reliability, scalability, and long-term sustainability from day one.  
**Community builder:** Successfully grew and maintained global research communities.  
**Data storyteller:** Authored 20+ peer-reviewed papers requiring clear communication of complex technical concepts to diverse audiences.  
**Continuous learner:** From R packages to PyTorch models to LangChain applications—I adapt to new technologies while maintaining deep expertise.
