Hello!

<i class="fa-solid fa-play"></i>
I'm a data scientist passionate about building dependable AI systems.
As a PhD-trained researcher, I have 15+ years of experience developing software used by 100+ research groups globally.
With expertise spanning AI systems, software engineering, and research methodology, I'm on a mission to make better AI tools for research.

<i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>
I love working with data, but my favorite part is building systems that are actually useful.
That means paying attention at both ends—from understanding user requirements to well-designed frontends.
I think evaluations and feedback loops are key to making a lasting impact with AI.

*I'm currently open to new opportunities.*
Reach out via <a href="mailto:j3ffdick@gmail.com">email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-m-dick/">LinkedIn</a> to discuss how we can work together.
