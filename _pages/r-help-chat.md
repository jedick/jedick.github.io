**The challenge**: Decades of valuable programming discussions buried in email archives, difficult to search effectively.

**My innovation**: A RAG-powered chatbot that transforms static archives into interactive knowledge discovery.

**Technical achievements**:
- Local models for **improved privacy** and **cost reduction** vs OpenAI
- **10% accuracy improvement** through hybrid dense+sparse retrieval
- LangGraph implementation with source citations for trustworthy responses
- Multi-turn conversational interface for complex technical queries
