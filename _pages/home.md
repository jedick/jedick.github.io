    title: Combating concept drift in LLM applications
    excerpt: >
      Your LLM application works beautifully at launch. 
      The model understands user preferences, accuracy metrics look great, and feedback is positive.
      Then, gradually—or sometimes suddenly—performance starts to degrade.
      Users complain.
      Metrics slide.

    title: Modern understanding of overfitting and generalization in machine learning
    excerpt: >
      The conventional wisdom about the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning has been dramatically challenged by modern neural networks.
      Traditionally, we believed that increasing model complexity would decrease bias but increase variance.
      However, recent research reveals that highly overparameterized models often generalize exceptionally well despite perfectly fitting the training data.

    excerpt: >
      This article provides a systematic comparison of transformer-based architectures for scientific claim verification,
      evaluating their performance across multiple datasets and examining the trade-offs between
      model complexity, computational efficiency, and generalization capabilities.
