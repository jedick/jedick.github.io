## History
- This site was originally generated from the [Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter) on 2024-11-13.
  - The *remote theme method* uses the `github-pages` gem which is [no longer maintained](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/36740) as of 2025.
- This site was converted to use the GitHub Actions workflow [Deploy Jekyll site to Pages](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/jekyll.yml) on 2025-12-29.
  - Thanks to [this answer by LindseyB](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/discussions/4007#discussioncomment-4130516) for pointing out the use of GitHub Actions with the *gem based method*.
