**The challenge:** Researchers spend countless hours manually verifying citations, while misinformation spreads through unchecked claims.

**The solution:** Shuffled training across multiple datasets lays the groundwork for breakthrough improvements in citation verification.

**Impact & innovation**:
- <strong>[pyvers](https://github.com/jedick/pyvers)</strong> package (based on PyTorch Lightning) automates preprocessing and training on claim verification datasets
- **7% improvement in F1 score** over state-of-the-art models through shuffled training methodology
- Real-time web app with **feedback collection** for model improvement
- **Production-ready deployment** with CI/CD pipeline ensuring reliability with every update
