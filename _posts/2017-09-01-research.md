📊 [Vignette](https://chnosz.net/vignettes/multi-metal.html)

Extended CHNOSZ capabilities to handle multi-metal systems using the mosaic stacking technique.
This methodological advancement enables construction of equilibrium diagrams for bimetallic minerals (e.g., Fe-V, Cu-Fe systems).
**Applications:** Hydrothermal geochemistry, materials science, ore deposit modeling, corrosion prediction.

## 🧬 Genome Evolution and the Environment

### Community- and genome-based evidence for redox influence on protein evolution
<i class="fa-solid fa-lock-open"></i> [*mSystems* (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00014-23)
📊 [Vignette](https://chnosz.net/JMDplots/vignettes/orp16S.html)

Demonstrated global- and local-scale correlations between environmental redox potential (Eh) and carbon oxidation state of proteins from microbial genomes.
This work shows that environmental redox conditions leave quantifiable signatures in genomic sequences.

### Thermodynamic approach to geochemical information from genomes
<i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i> [*Geobiology* (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12532)
📊 [Vignette](https://chnosz.net/JMDplots/vignettes/utogig.html)

Thermodynamic analysis of genomic data for extracting geochemical features (redox, pH, and temperatures),
with applications to deciphering environmental settings of past evolutionary transitions.

### Water activity and redox potential in evolution and development
<i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i> [*Journal of Molecular Evolution* (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00239-022-10051-7)
📊 [Vignette](https://chnosz.net/JMDplots/vignettes/evdevH2O.html)

Applied thermodynamic modeling to protein sequences across different gene ages, reconstructing redox conditions favoring protein formation through deep time.
Results support the hypothesis of life originating in reducing environments and provide a quantitative framework
for linking sequence data to ancient environmental chemistry.
**Technical contribution:** Integration of thermodynamic calculations with comparative genomics.

## 🦠 Human Body Chemistry: Microbiomes and Proteomes

### Chemical features of proteins in microbial genomes associated with body sites and gut inflammation
<i class="fa-solid fa-lock-open"></i> [*Biomedical Informatics* (2025)](https://doi.org/10.55092/bi20250003)
📊 [Vignette](https://chnosz.net/JMDplots/vignettes/microhum.html)

Applied computational analysis combining reference genomes with microbial abundances to quantify water and oxygen content of proteins at the community level.
Key findings:
(1) gut bacterial proteins have systematically lower water content compared to other body sites, indicating site-specific evolutionary adaptations, and
(2) obligate anaerobes (e.g., *Faecalibacterium*) have more oxidized proteins than aerotolerant bacteria, favoring survival during inflammatory oxidative stress.
**Data:** Multi-omics datasets including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics.

### Water as a reactant in differential protein expression in cancer

Analyzed hundreds of proteomic datasets to quantify stoichiometric hydration state (*n*H<sub>2</sub>O) in protein expression changes.
Found systematically higher values in cancer tissue compared to healthy tissue,
suggesting a physicochemical link between protein expression patterns and elevated cellular water content in tumors.
**Methods:** Large-scale analysis of chemical features in cancer proteomics datasets.

💾 [Model code on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15377396)

Quantified energetic controls on RNA formation from nucleotides across diverse environmental conditions relevant to the origin of life.
Used Gibbs energy calculations to predict nucleotide polymerization probability
and RNA length distributions as functions of temperature, pressure, pH, and composition.
**Computational framework:** CHNOSZ `mosaic()` function to handle complex speciation of ionizable compounds
(phosphate, nucleotides) across temperature-pressure-pH space.
This approach accounts for all possible charge states and their equilibrium proportions in solution.
